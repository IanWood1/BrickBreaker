#Brickbreaker
I build a Brick Breaker game for my computer engineering. The program was written in 32-bit Arm assembly specifically for an intel De1-Soc board. I thought it would be fun to rewrite the game but in C, and then compare the performance and look at the difference in generated binary.




## Running the game:
Compile the game with `make brickbreaker` ....


Make generates assembly that can be used with this [emulator] which compiles, runs the code, and provides I\O.
